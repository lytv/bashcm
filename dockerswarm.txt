docker swarm init --advertise-addr=192.169.1.10 

Swarm initialized: current node (5bkceslkq2xz4rhf37vwlbicd) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-2nskylr59ey6e584ewwxkxuc4u19f041o49fsvk3sucf4sv7x6-34e4ec6mu6mtlabn9u8lqyivk 192.169.1.10:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

open port for manager

Execute the following commands on the nodes that will function as Swarm managers:

    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ufw allow 2376/tcp
    ufw allow 2377/tcp
    ufw allow 7946/tcp
    ufw allow 7946/udp
    ufw allow 4789/udp

Afterwards, reload UFW:

    ufw reload

If UFW isn't enabled, do so with the following command:

    ufw enable

This might not be necessary, but it never hurts to restart the Docker daemon anytime you make changes to and restart the firewall:

systemctl restart docker


open port for worker


Then on each node that will function as a worker, execute the following commands:

    ufw allow 22/tcp
    ufw allow 2376/tcp
    ufw allow 7946/tcp 
    ufw allow 7946/udp 
    ufw allow 4789/udp 

Afterwards, reload UFW:

    ufw reload

If UFW isn't enabled, enable it:

    ufw enable

Then restart the Docker daemon:

systemctl restart docker
